# News Classification with BERT

## Overview
This project develops a news classification system using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. It demonstrates the effectiveness of BERT in semantic analysis for classifying news into various categories.

## Features
- Utilizes BERT for high-efficiency semantic analysis in NLP tasks.
- Includes data preprocessing, model training, and prediction stages.
- Demonstrates the process of dividing the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Transformers library
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
